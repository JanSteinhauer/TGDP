# Documentation for Hans Chat Application

## Overview

Hans Chat is a web-based chat application that integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to simulate conversations with Hans, a virtual character who speaks "Texas German" and has specific interests and knowledge areas. The application allows users to interact with Hans through a text-based interface, where they can ask questions or engage in conversation on various topics including Texas, Fredericksburg, World War II, and more.

## Features

- **React-based Application**: Utilizes React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **State Management with Hooks**: Leverages React's useState hook to manage chat input and messages.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Connects with OpenAI's API to generate conversational responses from Hans.
- **Customizable Profile**: Displays Hans' profile information and can be extended to allow user customization.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can send messages by typing and pressing enter, with chat history displayed on the screen.
